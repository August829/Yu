# Vulnerability

RCE

# Description

Although the code tries to clean up parseData using `safeExecuteUserFunction`, this blacklisting method is usually unreliable.Blacklist filtering can be bypassed,users can execute any system command without logging in.

# Analysis

The `search` method in `app/modules/cms/controller/collect.js`ï¼Œthe `getArticle` method also has a potential remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability. It gets the parseData from the request body and then uses `new Function()` to execute it.
Although the code tries to clean up parseData using `safeExecuteUserFunction`, this blacklisting method is usually unreliable. An attacker may find ways to bypass filtering and thus execute arbitrary JavaScript code. Since this is executed on the server side, it is an RCE vulnerability.

We reproduce this RCE vulnerability

Then we request the 666.txt written to see the execution result of the command:

Of course, you can also directly play a calculator to verify:
