# Vulnerability

Delete any file

# Description

The root of the vulnerability lies within the `getSentDir()` and `delete()` method in the `plugin/filemanager/controllers/FileManagerAPIController.php` file,users can delete any file on the server.

# Analysis

1. Flawed Path Filtering Logic in the `getSentDir()` Function

The root of the vulnerability lies within the `getSentDir()` method in the `plugin/filemanager/controllers/FileManagerAPIController.php` file. This method is responsible for processing user-supplied directory paths, but its security filtering mechanism is severely flawed.

- Filtering Logic: The code attempts to prevent directory traversal by checking if the *last part* of the path is `..`:

- The Flaw: This check is ineffective. When an attacker provides an input like `../../../../common`, the path is split into the array `['..', '..', '..', '..', 'common']`. The code only inspects the last element, `'common'`, causing the security check to be completely bypassed. All the `..` sequences are preserved.

- The Result: The function proceeds to concatenate this unfiltered, malicious path with the base upload directory (`data/upload/files/`), constructing an illegal path that points to an arbitrary folder within the application's root, such as the `common` directory.

2. Blind Trust in Unsafe Input by the `delete()` Function

The `delete()` method is where the vulnerability is triggered. It makes the following mistakes when performing the deletion operation:

- Calling an Untrusted Function: It first calls the flawed `getSentDir()` method, obtaining a directory path that has been manipulated by the attacker.
- Lack of Secondary Validation: It completely trusts the path returned by `getSentDir()` without performing any additional security checks (e.g., using `realpath()` to verify that the path is within the allowed directory).
- Direct Use of User Input: It directly takes the filename from `$_POST['filename']` and immediately executes the deletion operation on the manipulated path.

Attack Flow Summary

An attacker sends a specially crafted POST request, controlling both the `fmFolderToSee` and `filename` parameters:

1. The value of `fmFolderToSee` (e.g., `../../../../common`) exploits the flaw in `getSentDir()` to "traverse" the operating directory to a critical application directory.
2. The value of `filename` (e.g., `config.php`) specifies the target file to be deleted within that critical directory.
3. The `delete()` method blindly executes these instructions, ultimately leading to the severe consequence of arbitrary file deletion.
